# MultiMix

* Objects with auto-generated property chains

* class `Hedge`
  * purpose: enable turning property access to function calls
    * propoerties may be predefined
    * or auto-generated, either
      * as plain objects
      * or by calling a custom factory function
    * example:

      ```coffee
      handler = ( hedges, a, b, c ) ->
        log hedges, [ a, b, c, ]
        return null
      h = new Hedge { handler, }
      h.foo
      # [ 'foo',  ]
      ```

* since hubs and properties are proxies, can do things on property access, no call needed, so both `d.foo`
  and `d.foo 42` can potentially do things

* 'handler': function to be called on prop access, call, or both

* 'hub': optional reference / base object (re 'hub': as if props were spokes)


* `cfg`:

  * `cfg.create`: ??????????????????
    * `true`: missing props will be auto-generated as plain objects
    * `true`: no missing props will be generated
    * a function: to be called, return value becomes new property where property is missing
