# MultiMix

An ES6 `class` with some metaprogramming capabilities:

* easy to mixin instance methods from an arbitrary number of objects;
* easy to mixin static (class) methods from an arbitrary number of objects;
* sample implementation for a kind of 'keymethod proxies' (essentially instance method with custum special
  behavior);
* ability to 'export' an object with methods bound to a particular instance (great in conjunction with ES6
  object destructuring).


Implementation was inspired by / copy-pasted from [Chapter 3 of *The Little Book on
CoffeeScript*](https://arcturo.github.io/library/coffeescript/03_classes.html).
